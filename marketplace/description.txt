Fourmilab Chaos Butterfly demonstrates the phenomenon of chaos in classical mechanics by implementing a Lorenz system, the mathematical model originally developed by Edward Lorenz in 1963 based on convection in the Earth's atmosphere.  As Lorenz studied the behaviour of his model, simulated on a rudimentary computer system, he discovered that even the slightest change in the starting point would result in an entirely different evolution of the system with time.  This was the first discovery of the mathematical phenomenon of chaos and what has come to be called the "butterfly effect": where the beating of the wings of a single butterfly in a jungle halfway around the world may result in the formation of a hurricane on the other.

Fourmilab Chaos Butterfly lets you create one or more butterflies which fly through the air in Second Life along the trajectories of the Lorenz model, demonstrating its chaotic behaviour.  You can sit on a butterfly and experience the wild ride for yourself, with chat commands allowing you to set any of the parameters of the model and observe how they alter its behaviour.  You can also wear the butterfly as an avatar accessory, which lets you fly with it in areas where you do not have permission to create objects.

The model is fully scriptable with commands supplied in notecards in its inventory and scripts may define pop-up menus through which an avatar may interact with the model.  A collection of butterfly textures are included so you can distinguish multiple butterflies from one another or just choose one you find pleasing.  A Deployer is included, which makes it easy to hatch as many butterflies as you wish, each of which will wheel and gyre through the sky of your simulation.

Land Impact and Permissions

Fourmilab Chaos Butterfly has a land impact of 1.  To rez it, you must have land on which you are permitted to create objects (land you own, whose owner has granted you permission, or a public sandbox).  The creation of lines to trace the path of flight creates temporary prims which, while they do not count against land impact, do require the owner of the object to have permission to create objects on the land where it resides.  If you wear the butterfly as an avatar attachment, it has no land impact and may be used regardless of whether you have permission to create objects.

Development Kit

Fourmilab Chaos Butterfly is delivered including a development kit containing all of the object components, models, scripts, and documents used in the objects.  All items including scripts, have “full permissions” (copy, modify, and transfer), so that you can use them as the basis for your own development projects and/or share them with other users in Second Life.
