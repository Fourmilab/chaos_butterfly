                        Development Log


2022 September 26

Added Set variables for all Lorentz parameters: beta, rho, sigma, and
deltaT.  These may be either floats or rationals, and if the value is
omitted, resets the variable to the default.

Added Set variable for scale.

Added all new variables to the Status output.  Added running and
attached to Status, and show to whom we're attached if so.

Replaced the original Test/Quit command structure with a:
    Run on/off/time/async
command as in Double Pendulum.

Added the:
    Set path on/off/lines [ permanent/clear ]
mechanism from Double Pendulum.  I found that the same 12 line plotter
scripts we used in that object seem to keep up and avoid message loss
here.

Added a Set path width n command to set the width of paths, both
particle and line.  Note that particle width cannot be set below
0.3125 and line width will be snapped to the closest of the values
supported by the line plotters: 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025.  Thus, you'll
want to tune this setting based upon the kind of path you're going to
draw.

Installed the link message code to support scripts and menus.

Installed a "Script: Configuration" to test script execution.

2022 September 27

A great many things were messed up regarding drawing lines for trails.
First of all, the scripts for permanent and temporary line prims had
different tables for widths, resulting in absurdly fat lines when
permanent prims were selected.  The temporary prim script lacked the
code to set PRIM_TEMP_ON_REZ based upon its name, and hence required a
hard temporary setting in the prim definition, resulting in the
"peekaboo prim" problem when editing it.  Finally, the temporary prim's
script was from the Orbits literary output and lacked all comments.  As
fixed, the two scripts are now absolutely identical and determine their
permanence from their names.

Added the ability to plot critical points, depending upon the current
parameters, with:
    Set critical [ permanent ]
This draws axes gnomons at the critical points.  These are usually
temporary prims, but you can make them permanent by so specifying.
They will be cleared by Set path line clear.

On further reflection, changed the drawing of critical point gnomons
to use the colours of the viewer labeling of axes: X red, Y green, Z
blue.

Added "Set path colour <r,g,b>" to set the colour of both particle and
line paths.

Licensed a collection of nine butterfly textures from:
    https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/collection-multicolored-butterflies-vector-illustration-1912569607
These are EPS vector images which I converted into PNGs with
transparency using Gimp to import the EPS at 300 dpi, then cropped,
scaled, and added transparency.  I may see if I can find some natural
photos of real butterflies to add as well.

Added a "Set offset <x,y,z>" command to set the offset from the initial
position of the butterfly to where it begins flight.  This is usually
used to raise the flight display so it doesn't intersect the ground,
but you can set it however you wish.

There is a mystery when attached to an avatar.  If you perform a run,
then stop, and then run again, sometimes, but not always, the avatar
just remains stuck at the starting position.  Trace shows the
llMoveToTarget calls are being made to correct locations, the avatar is
physical, and that everything seems normal, but the avatar doesn't
move.  If you then use the viewer button to stop flying, suddenly the
avatar starts moving normally, but with the "falling" animation.  If
you then put the avatar back in flying mode, everything is fine again.
I have tried forcing a llStopMoveToTarget(), delays, etc., but nothing
so far has made any difference once you get in this stuck mode.  The
only way to escape seems to be the manual stop flying while you're
stuck.  I have no idea what is going on.

Added a "Set texture name" command which replaces the butterfly texture
with the named one in the inventory.  These texture names must be all
lower case and contain no spaces, since I don't want to bring in the
big and messy inventoryName function we use elsewhere.  If no name is
specified, textures in the inventory are listed.

Installed an automatic scaling mechanism so that the hue range of
trails in polychrome mode accurately reflects the extreme excursion
based upon the current parameters.  Whenever a run is started or any
of the parameters change, updateScale() is called which performs
1000 iterations and records the maximum excursion from the closest
critical point by the trajectory.  This is stored in maxExcursion,
which is used to scale the hue in which the trail is drawn.

Changed the Run on command to start the simulation at a randomly
chosen point between 1/6 and 1/5 along a vector connecting critical
points 1 and 2.

Added the ability to texture with top and bottom butterfly images.
The "Set texture" command now looks for a companion image with the
specified name and "-bottom" appended.  If found, that image is placed
on the bottom of the butterfly prim.

Made a top and bottom set for "butterfly10" from the Wikimedia image of

After many hours of experimentation, I am getting a few glimmers of
enlightenent on why particle trails do not align with critical point
gnomons when we're attached to an avatar.  The key clue is that line
trails, which are placed based upon the transformed Lorenz co-ordinates
work just fine.  What's happening with particles is, in short, that
we're moving the avatar to follow the trajectory which causes it to
move its centre of mass (the hip bone) to the position we specify.
But the attachment is to another bone (usually the chest), and this
not only has an offset from the avatar position, that offset varies as
the avatar moves.  To correct for this offset, we would need to get the
real-time offset from the avatar position to the attachment position,
and I can't find any way to do this.

We may just have to live with this.  If you want trails that align with
the Set crit points whie attached, use Set path lines.  Otherwise, it's
going to be wonky.

Another infelicitous behaviour of particle trails is that since the
particle emitter in the butterfly is offset from the avatar's centre,
when the avatar turns, you will get a discontinuity in the trail.  The
only way to keep that from happening would be to make a two prim
butterfly in which there was a prim to be attached to the avatar centre
but transparent, to hold the particle emitter, and another, visible, to
actually do the work.  I find it difficult to justify all of this
complexity to remedy a minor cosmetic problem which I suspect few
people will ever encounter since most won't ever wear the butterfly as
an attachment in the first place.

Added a general lorenz2Region() function to transform Lorenz
co-ordinates to region co-ordinates rather than writing it out in three
places.  Added logic to the function to rotate by the rotation of the
object at the time the Run started, allowing control of the orientation
of the trails in region space.  Made the restoration of starting point
at Run off also restore the initial rotation rather than resetting to a
fixed value.  This applies also when attached to an avatar.  The path
flown in the sky will depend upon the initial rotation of the flying
avatar at the time of the "Run on".

Made a texture, top and bottom, of the Millennium Falcon from:
    https://www.the-millennium-falcon.com/2018/03/12/done/
It isn't just butterflies any more!

When you started in paths mode, you'd often get a particle trail from
the start point to the first computed point on the trajectory even
though the particle system was only enabled after the move to the start
of the trajectory.  This appears to be because we used
llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast() for the move and it was too fast--the
viewer enabled the particle system before it got the command to start
the move.  I added a 0.2 second llSleep() after the initial move before
enabling the particle system and that appears to have fixed it.

Added a plotLine() function to assemble and send the request to a Line
plotter to draw a line in space and replaced all of the written-out
instances of this code with a call to the function.

If the user tried to "Set critical" before a Run was started, the
critical points would be drawn in the wrong place because the initial
position and rotation of the object had not been captured.  Trying to
obtain them in the Set critical command could mess things up when the
command was issued while running, so I simply added a test to reject
the command except when a simulation was running.

2022 October 1

To allow different levels of trace information, I added the ability
to "Set trace n" which sets it to the given value.  The "on" setting
corresponds to n = 1.

Created a Git repository and made an initial commit of the current
state of development, including scripts, textures, notecards, and this
log.




Notes and to-do:

    (Place particle emitter in link, and then position link at the
     co-ordinates that put it at avatar's centre point.  But this won't
     work as skeleton moves the attachment and link away from that.)


    * More than one run session with attached object.
    * Reset command to restore initial settings
    * Offset of crit points when wearing
    * Deployer, like Hatch in Birds
